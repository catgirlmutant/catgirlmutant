Hewwo! I'm Esther, aka mutant! I'm from Hong Kong, and currently in high school. I'm barely a programmer lol
<h3> Hobbies </h3>
I like to play the piano, sing, take photos, and play videogames. I'm also extremely hooked on music (as you may have seen from my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3Soa8cZIVTv7qSerC3E57i/"> 38 hour spotify playlist </a> ;P
<h3> What I plan on doing </h3>
nothing really, I just want to focus on my studies and start a few random projects here and there. I also started taking up street photography as a hobby, so here's my <a href=https://unsplash.com/@catgirlmutant> unsplash page </a> where I post my photos. Also, here's <a href="https://catgirlmutant.carrd.co"> my Carrd page </a> that has links to my social media accounts and other stuff. My discord is <b>mutant#4592</b> for those who need it.

<br><b> anyways, I hope anyone who's reading this have a great day!! :3</b>
