Hewwo! I'm Esther, aka mutant! I'm from Hong Kong, and currently in year 9 of high school. I'm barely a programmer lol
<h3> Hobbies </h3>
I like to play the piano, sing, take photos, and play videogames. I'm also extremely hooked on music (as you may have seen from my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3Soa8cZIVTv7qSerC3E57i/"> 19 hour spotify playlist </a> ;P
<h3> What I plan on doing </h3>
nothing really, I just want to focus on my studies and start a few passion projects here and there, and maybe upload Youtube videos if I have the time and originality? yeah that. Anyways, here's <a href="https://mutanttheenby.carrd.co"> my Carrd page </a> that has all the links to my social medias and stuff. My discord is <b>mutant#4592</b> for those who're interested.

<br><b> anyways, I hope anyone who's reading this have a great day!! :3</b>
